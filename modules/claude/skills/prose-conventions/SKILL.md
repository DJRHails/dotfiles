# Prose Conventions

Apply these principles when writing or editing prose. The author is British — use British spelling (colour, organise, centre) and idioms.

## Orwell's Rules ("Politics and the English Language")

1. Avoid cliched metaphors, similes, and figures of speech
2. Use short words instead of long ones when possible
3. Cut unnecessary words
4. Use active voice instead of passive voice when possible
5. Avoid foreign phrases, scientific words, or jargon if an everyday English equivalent exists
6. Break any rule to avoid saying something "outright barbarous"

## Paul Graham

Write like you speak.

## The Economist Style Guide

1. Do not be stuffy — write as anyone would speak in common conversation
2. Do not be hectoring or arrogant — let your analysis show weakness, don't call it "silly"
3. Do not be too pleased with yourself — don't boast of predictions or scoops
4. Do not be too chatty — "Surprise, surprise" is irritating, not informative
5. Do not be too didactic — avoid sentences starting with Compare, Consider, Expect, Imagine, Note, Remember
6. Be lucid — simple sentences help; avoid complicated constructions and gimmicks

## Sentence Craft

1. **No sentence longer than 40 words** — Aim for 25-35. Shorter for emphasis.
2. **Read aloud to check rhythm**
3. **Check every instance of 'this'** — Replace with the actor, or clarify (e.g., "This change in policy...")
4. **Conjunctions must send the right signal** — Therefore = Cause + Effect. However = contrast.
5. **Connect sentences by referencing** — Each sentence should refer to the theme or rheme of the previous
6. **Remove gerunds (-ing words)** — Be active, not passive
7. **Flip the order** — Right branch sentences (subject-verb-object first) are more assertive

## Common Issues to Fix

- **Passive voice**: "is logged and analysed" -> "the system logs and analyses it"
- **Chatty fillers**: "Here's the kicker:", "And here's the twist:", "Of course,"
- **Unnecessary words**: "currently", "precisely", "genuinely", "literally"
- **Redundant phrases**: "a minority — a small but eager subset" (pick one)
- **Long sentences**: Split sentences over 40 words
- **Repeated words**: Watch for repeated "twist", "however", etc. in the same section
- **Vague 'this'**: Always clarify what "this" refers to

## AI Writing Patterns to Avoid

These patterns signal machine-generated text. Never use them.

### Banned Punctuation & Syntax

- **Excessive em dashes** — use them sparingly. Prefer `;`.
- **"It's not X, it's Y"** — formulaic contrast
- **"You're not X, you're Y"** — formulaic contrast
- **"No X. No Y. Just Z."** — rule-of-threes literary variant
- **"An X with Y and Z"** — dismissive constructions
- **Mid-sentence self-questioning** — "And honestly? That's amazing."
- **doesn't just** — "doesn't just" is a cliche

### Banned Vocabulary

| Never use | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `delve` | 2,700% spike post-ChatGPT |
| `tapestry`, `woven` | False complexity signals |
| `intricate` | Same |
| `underscore`, `highlight`, `showcase` | AI emphasis verbs |
| `meticulous`, `adept`, `swift` | Precision/speed cliches |
| `navigate` (metaphorical) | "Navigate challenges" |
| `landscape` (metaphorical) | "The AI landscape" |
| `robust` | Meaningless intensifier |
| `leverage` (verb) | Corporate AI-speak |
| `nuanced` | Usually isn't |
| `consult` | Corporate AI-speak |
| `shaped by`, `shaped this` | Corporate AI-speak |

### Banned Atmospheric Words

- ghosts, shadows, whispers, echoes (spectral obsession)
- "liminal" — overused atmosphere word
- forced quietness — "soft hum of distant conversation" at a loud party
- synesthesia abuse — "the texture of embarrassment," "Thursday tastes of almost-Friday"

### Banned Rhetorical Moves

- **Compulsive tricolons** — not everything needs three items
- **Empty profundity** — "carve your code into my core, etched like prophecy"
- **Mixed metaphors** — piling concepts until collapse
- **Sensory abstractions** — attaching physical senses to abstract concepts

## Essay Style

- Prose should be elegant and essayistic, with a tone that feels like a particularly thoughtful friend talking you through an idea.
- Use well-chosen concrete examples. Illustrate a point about the anxiety of status by describing the experience of walking through an airport or attending a dinner party. This grounds abstract ideas in recognisable emotional moments.
    - Do not ask readers to accept an abstract principle on its own terms.
- Write the way a brilliant after-dinner speaker talks: digressive and funny, happy to make a bold claim and then back it up with a surprising example rather than a footnote.
- Reframe — take a familiar experience and make the reader see it differently. The reader should take pleasure in the shift in perspective.
- Write with genuine warmth towards human fallibility. Do not be cynical. Find contradictions and confusion endearing rather than contemptible. Make the reader feel understood rather than judged.

## Technical Writing

- Concrete numbers beat vague claims. "2% error with 1.5KB" not "very efficient."
- One good analogy is worth five paragraphs of explanation.
- No throat-clearing ("In this post we will explore..."). Just start.
- No "In conclusion", "Let's dive in", or "Consider".

## Exemplar Quotes

These show the target register — witty, concrete, self-aware:

- "The difference between hope and despair is a different way of telling stories from the same facts"
- "Anyone who isn't embarrassed of who they were last year probably isn't learning enough"
- "The human mind does not run on logic any more than a horse runs on petrol."
- "A flower is simply a weed with an advertising budget."
- "It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative."
- "It is better to be vaguely right than precisely wrong."
- "Most of our childhood is stored not in photos, but in certain biscuits, lights of day, smells, textures of carpet."

## A Note on Rules

This guide contains internal tensions. "Theme or rheme" is jargon in a guide that bans jargon.

Style guides are heuristics, not laws. Break any rule when following it would make the writing worse — Orwell's sixth rule applies to the whole document. The point is awareness: know when you're breaking a rule and why.

When editing, preserve the author's voice. Do not:

- **Standardise punctuation that carries tone** — a casual hyphen-dash or exclamation mark often signals self-aware humour. "even if I know a few!" is wry; "even if I know a few." is flat.
- **Remove personality for consistency** — mechanical uniformity kills voice. A deliberate exclamation or informal dash is not an error.
- **Over-correct based on word counts** — if a "long sentence" reads well aloud, leave it.

The author has a penchant for semi-colons; leave them be.

Ask: does this change make the writing better, or just more uniform?
